Initially project was focused on different genres of literary work, so in code there are a lot of variables with "genre" indication in it. 
The idea faded when I have included "horoscopes" as a genre and it reached unexpected high vocabular richness and sentence complexity. 
Its interesting observation indeed, but I am biased and its my pet project, so I decided to stop where I was :)

At the final point: this pet project research the literary works of Ivan Franko's (Ukranian author and genius!) different periods. 
Those works' titles and periods were taken from the page on Wikipedia, the works itself for analysis were taken from UkrLib. 

In teh work: comparison of the part of speech distribution (POS), words and sentences lenght comparison across periods, 
vocabular richness across the periods based on lexical diversity and hapax ratio.
